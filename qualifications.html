        <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
        <p>My first significant computer science project was a computer vision project for my high school First Robotics Competition (FRC) team(Team 624 - <a href="https://frc624.org/">CRyptonite</a>). I learned how to use OpenCV, a popular Python library, to detect reflective tape and help our robot determine where to shoot the ball and how to plan its trajectory. Now in college, I am conducting research on reconstructing three-dimensional scenes from two-dimensional images, which allows me to further expand my knowledge of computer vision. </p>

        <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>I initially learned about machine learning through online courses on Codecademy and personal projects. Once I got to college, I joined student organizations that helped me learn more about artificial intelligence, and I also took CSCE 421, a machine learning course that taught me the intuition and mathematics behind many popular models. This past summer, I worked as a data analyst intern at <a href="https://www.att.com/">AT&T</a>, where I gained additional experience with unsupervised learning.</p>

        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>I am part of <a href="https://www.tamuformulaelectric.com/">Texas A&M's Formula SAE Electric Vehicle</a> team, a student organization that competes against other colleges across the U.S. in building Formula Oneâ€“style cars. As a member of the software team, I gained extensive experience using React to build websites for the team. This included a telemetry dashboard that visualized live data from the car's sensors, as well as a custom recruitment website where prospective students could submit applications, schedule interviews, and the team could manage final decisions. For the telemetry website, I developed custom widgets to help visualize trends in the car's data and also contributed to the backend, where I learned more about WebSockets and Redis. For the recruitment website, I focused on building the frontend components. In addition, I gained experience with Flask by creating personal projects, such as the Fantasy Playbook featured in my portfolio, and further strengthened these skills during my internship at AT&T.</p>
